Rage is a video and audio player written with Enlightenment
Foundation Libraries with some extra bells and whistles.

It is a simple video and audio player intended to be slick
yet simplistic, much like Mplayer. You can provide 1 or
more files to play on the command-line or just DND files
onto the rage window to insert them into the playlist.
Or just run it with no arguments to get a video browser
mode like a media center.
